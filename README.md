# vision_models

Recognizing the need for more accessible alternatives to large pretrained vision models on imagenet, this repo aims to provide models pretrained on smaller datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10. These models are designed to be lighter and more manageable, facilitating quick experimentation and integration into projects where resources are limited.

Roadmap:
* mnist
  shallow CNN

* CIFAR10
  shallow CNN
  
For easy import and utilization, explore these pretrained models tailored for efficiency and convenience.
